# Release Criteria

The final shipping stage begins once a build satisfies all mandatory release gates. The team should only push to production when the following criteria are met:

- **Bug bar** – No open P0 or P1 issues remain.
- **Performance SLOs** – Latest runs meet the agreed service level objectives.
- **Accessibility pass** – Screens and flows have completed an A11y review.
- **Telemetry dashboards** – Key metrics are wired and monitored.
- **Copy QA** – User-facing strings reviewed for tone and localization.
- **Store assets** – Listing images, descriptions, and icons are finalized.

Meeting these gates means the build is ready to progress through final store submission and staged rollout.
