# Challenges Feed

## Problem & Vision
Communities need a place to surface local or sector problems and collaborate on solving them. A reddit-style feed helps capture issues quickly while keeping discussion focused and respectful.

## Objectives
- High-signal feed of community problems
- Filters by tags and regions
- Safe and civil discussions

## MVP Scope
- Create challenge (title, description, tags[], optional location, links[])
- Vote (up/down), comment, report, follow
- Feeds: Hot, New, Top (day/week/month/all), Rising, Near Me (optional)

## Out of Scope
- Solution bounties
- Full threading
- Org verification
- Map view
- AR capture

## Success Metrics
- Weekly active posters
- Vote-through rate
- Comments per post
- Report rate
- Unique tag adoption
- D7 retention for followers
