# TKT-205 Monetization Scaffold v1

## Context
Introduce a payment provider abstraction with a safe disabled default.

## Requirements
- Define `IPaymentProvider` interface and `NoopPaymentProvider`.
- Gate payment flows behind `PAYMENTS_ENABLED` flag.
- Update seller profile to validate amounts and respect flag.

## Data Contracts
- `monetization/intents` documents: `{type, amount, currency, targetUserId?, productId?, createdBy, createdAt, status}`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No external provider keys required when flag off.
- UI shows "Payments disabled" when flag off.

## Runtime Flags
- `PAYMENTS_ENABLED` (`bool`, default `false`).

## Metrics
- Count of created intents.
- Disabled flow clicks.

## Risks
- Misconfigured flag could expose unfinished payment UI.
- Synthetic IDs may collide; low risk given timestamp.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for service with flag on/off.
- Widget test for disabled UI.

## Rollback
- Disable flag and remove deployed intents.
