# TKT-203 Referral Share v1

## Context
Users want an easy way to invite friends by sharing a referral code.

## Requirements
- Add a share button to the referrals screen that launches the platform share sheet using `share_plus` with the message `Join me on Fouta. Code: <code>`.
- The button must expose a semantics label for screen readers and remain focusable via keyboard.
- No data model changes; codes are random UUIDs that do not contain PII.

## Budgets
- p95 latency under 800 ms.
- Storage and egress growth under 20 % month-over-month.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Share button appears on the referrals screen and announces "Share referral code" to assistive tech.
- Tapping the button invokes `Share.share` with the current code.
- Automated test covers button presence and share invocation.

## Risks
- Dependency bloat from new plugin.
- Possible misuse of referral codes.

## Rollback
Remove the `share_plus` dependency and delete the share handler and button.
