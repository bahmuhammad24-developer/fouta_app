# TKT-207 Seller Onboarding v1

## Context
Creators need a lightweight path to become sellers. Currently the "Start Selling" button goes straight to product creation without collecting seller details or persisting a seller profile.

## Requirements & Acceptance Criteria
- When a user taps "Start Selling" and does not yet have a seller profile, show a seller onboarding form.
- Form collects `displayName` (required) and `bio` (optional).
- Submitting the form creates a Firestore document under `sellers/{uid}` with `displayName`, optional `bio`, and `createdAt` timestamp.
- After successful submission, navigate back to the Marketplace screen.
- Existing sellers continue directly to the create product flow.

## Data Contracts
`/sellers/{uid}`
```
{
  displayName: string,
  bio?: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Runtime Flags
None for v1. Feature is gated by presence of seller profile.

## Metrics
- Count of completed seller onboarding flows.
- Time from app install to first seller onboarding completion.

## Risks
1. **Abandoned forms** – mitigated by keeping form minimal.
2. **Unauthorized writes** – Firestore rules must restrict to authenticated user ID (future work).
3. **Data inconsistency** – handled via single document write.
4. **Navigation loops** – after submission, ensure return to previous screen.
5. **Accessibility issues** – rely on standard widgets and labels.

## Test Plan
- Unit test `SellerService` Firestore writes.
- Widget tests verifying navigation to onboarding vs. product creation.
- `flutter analyze`, `dart format`, `flutter test`.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert navigation to always open `CreateProductScreen`.
- Remove `SellerOnboardingScreen` and `SellerService`.
