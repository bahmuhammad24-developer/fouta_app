## Marketplace & AR Notes

- AR camera has been stubbed and removed from settings until it is integrated into marketplace AR features.
- Marketplace now shows a "Start Selling" banner to guide first-time sellers.
- Once the product creation flow is ready, update `MarketplaceScreen` to link directly to the listing creation experience.
- Seller onboarding screen collects basic profile info and appears when non-sellers tap "Start Selling".
