# Vision

Fouta is built for the global majority, prioritizing open dialogue on issues that affect vulnerable communities. Content will not be suppressed for political sensitivity, while safety tools empower users to report abuse and curate their experience.

## Roadmap

- **Content discovery and feed ranking** – hashtags, search, and personalized algorithms to surface relevant conversations.
- **Moderation and safety** – robust reporting and community moderation queues that preserve critical discussions.
- **Growth and onboarding** – social graph imports, referrals, and guided flows to help new users connect.
- **Creation tools** – AR filters, captioning, and lightweight video editing to empower storytellers.
- **Analytics and scalability** – usage metrics, error logging, and load testing to ensure reliability at scale.
- **Monetization and partnerships** – explore ads, subscriptions, and community collaborations to sustain the platform.
