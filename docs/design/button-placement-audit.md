# Button Placement Audit

Records the placement of primary and secondary actions on Marketplace screens.

## MarketplaceScreen

- **Sell / Start Selling:** FoutaButton placed at the top of the feed for quick access. Label adapts based on whether the user already has listings.
- **Filter:** Icon button lives in the app bar actions for a predictable spot.
- **Product Card:** Favorite icon in the image corner; tapping the card opens details.

## ProductDetailScreen

- **Buy:** Primary FoutaButton shown first in the details column.
- **Message Seller:** Secondary FoutaButton positioned directly under the buy action.
- **AR Camera:** Not surfaced; reserved for future integration.

### Rationale

- Primary action appears at top/right or first in a vertical stack.
- Related actions are grouped together.
- Important CTAs stay above the fold to support quick completion of key tasks.
