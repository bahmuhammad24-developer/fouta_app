# Profile & Seller Feature Access Audit

## Profile Screen
- **Edit Profile**: Primary button displayed prominently beneath the profile header for the owner.
- **Settings**: Secondary button beside Edit Profile offering quick access to account configuration.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Primary action when viewing another user, placed alongside communication options.
- **Message**: Secondary button next to Follow, allowing direct contact.
- **Content Tabs**: Posts, Shorts, and About tabs surface browsing options below the action area.

**Assessment:** Placement of personal actions (edit, settings) mirrors expected editing flow. For other profiles, social actions (follow, message) are grouped logically, improving discovery before content.

## Seller Profile Screen
- **Message seller**: Secondary button enabling communication, shown above product listings.
- **Support Creator**: Primary button for tips, adjacent to messaging for clear monetary entry.
- **View Products**: Product grid appears after action buttons, matching shopping flow.

**Assessment:** Monetary and communication actions are grouped at the top, keeping commerce features before browsing inventory.

## Recommendations
- Consider a dedicated action bar to host future features (e.g., share profile, report).
- Explore contextual placement for "Support Creator" on standard profiles when payments expand.
- Revisit product grid ordering if more seller tools are introduced.
